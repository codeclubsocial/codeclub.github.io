# <a name="text_editor"></a>Text Editor
In order to write software you'll need a text editor. You may have heard of editors like Vi/Vim, Emacs, Nano, Sublime and Atom. There is no correct answer to the question of which one you should use. Your choice will come down to personal preference. [Vi](http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/), [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and Nano are usually command line text editors. [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/) are standalone desktop text editors.
