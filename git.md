## <a name="git"></a>Git
Git is an essential part of your coding toolkit. Whether you are coding a solo project or contributing to a group project, you'll want to manage your codebase by committing your progress to a git repository.

A free and open source distributed version control system, Git is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. ([source](https://git-scm.com/]))
