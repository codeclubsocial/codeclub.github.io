# Getting Started

### Welcome to CodeClub!

This guide will walk you through the basics of what you will need to get started coding.
The first thing you will want to do is install these tools to your system. They will make
it possible to write and run your code, and keep it organized.

### Tools you will need:
1. [Text Editor](text_editor.md)
2. [Git](git.md)
3. [Github.com Account](github.md)
4. [Node.js](node.md)
5. [MongoDB](mongo.md)

Next, lets learn to program. It can be challenging to figure out where to start
and in what order you should study the material.

### Things you need to know:
1. [HTML & CSS](htmlcss.md)
2. [JavaScript](js.md)
3. [Git CL Syntax](git_cl.md)

Most of your time will be focused on the JavaScript language. When combined with Node, it will require
months of building apps before you no longer feel like a totalmdd cm beginner. But that's
okay, because programming gives you super powers. HTML & CSS are also very important,
however it shouldn't take longer than a couple weeks to get comfortable with them.
HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. It is intended describe the
the visual appearance of the web page.

On the other hand, while the tools are equally as important, they require much
less time to master and gain fluency. Ready or not, the process of coding forces
you to use them and explore their features.
