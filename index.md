# Getting Started

### Welcome to CodeClub!

This guide will walk you through the basics of what you will need to get started coding.
The first thing you will want to do is install these tools to your system. They will make
it possible to write and run your code, and keep it organized.

### Tools you will need:
1. [Text Editor](text_editor.md)
2. [Git](git.md)
3. [Github.com Account](github.md)
4. [Node.js](node.md)
5. [MongoDB](mongo.md)

Next, lets learn to program. It can be challenging to figure out where to start
and in what order you should study the material.

Most of your time will be spent with the JavaScript language. However, HTML & CSS are also very important.
If you are not comfortable with HTML/CSS you should focus on learning them first. It should only take a couple of weeks to get comfortable with them. HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. It is intended describe the the visual appearance of the web page. CSS is an enhancement to HTML.

Knowing how to use Git is a basic requirement of any coder's repertoire. Coding without Git is like driving across Arizona in the summer without an air conditioning. You can do it, but it's not recommended.

Once you have all the tools installed you can begin learning how to code.

### Things you need to know:
1. [HTML & CSS](htmlcss.md)
2. [JavaScript](js.md)
3. [Git CL Syntax](git_cl.md)
